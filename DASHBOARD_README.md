# Dashboard Functionality Documentation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Data Display
- **Daily Sales Summary**: Shows actual sales for the current day
- **Transaction Count**: Displays the number of transactions made today
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Shows products with stock levels at or below 10 units
- **Recent Transactions**: Displays the 5 most recent sales with details
- **Session Timer**: Shows active session duration in HH:MM:SS format

### 2. Firebase Integration

- **Data Fetching**: All data is fetched from Firebase Firestore collections
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and loading indicators

### 3. Interactive Features
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Swipe down to refresh dashboard data
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons for common actions (Start Sale, View Reports, etc.)
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation between different screens
- **Role-based Access**: Different features available based on user role (Admin/Cashier)

## Data Sources

### Firebase Collections Used
1. **`products`** - Product inventory data
2. **`sales`** - Sales transaction data

### Dashboard Statistics Calculated
- Today's total sales amount
- Today's transaction count
- Total products in inventory
- Low stock items count
- Average transaction value
- Session duration

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `components/services/dashboard.js` - Dashboard data service functions
- `components/context/DashboardContext.js` - Dashboard state management
- `setup-sample-data.js` - Utility to add sample data for testing

### Modified Files
- `components/screen/DashboardScreen.js` - Updated to use real data
- `App.js` - Added DashboardProvider wrapper

## How to Test

### 1. Add Sample Data
To test the dashboard with sample data, you can run:
```javascript
// In your browser console or Node.js environment
import addSampleData from './setup-sample-data.js';
addSampleData();
```

### 2. Sample Data Includes
- **5 Products**: Tea, Coffee, and Dairy items with varying stock levels
- **5 Sales Transactions**: Various payment methods and amounts
- **Low Stock Items**: Products with stock ≤ 10 units

### 3. Expected Dashboard Display
After adding sample data, you should see:
- Daily sales amount (sum of today's transactions)
- Transaction count for today
- Low stock alerts for items with ≤ 10 stock
- Recent transaction list with sale IDs and amounts
- Real-time session timer

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Sales Summary Card
- Displays today's total sales in Philippine Peso (₱)
- Shows transaction count for the day
- Updates automatically when new sales are made

### 2. Low Stock Alerts
- Lists products with stock ≤ 10 units
- Shows product name and current stock level
- Updates when inventory is modified

### 3. Statistics Cards
- **Today's Transactions**: Count of sales made today
- **Active Session**: Timer showing session duration
- **Total Products**: Count of all products in inventory
- **Low Stock Items**: Count of products with low stock
- **Average Transaction**: Average sale amount

### 4. Recent Transactions
- Shows last 5 sales with:
  - Sale ID
  - Transaction amount
  - Time of transaction
- Updates in real-time

### 5. Quick Actions
- **Quick Sale**: Navigate to POS screen
- **View Reports**: Navigate to reports screen
- **Inventory**: Navigate to inventory management (Admin only)
- **Settings**: Navigate to settings (Admin only)
- **Profile**: Navigate to profile screen
- **Refresh**: Manually refresh dashboard data

## Error Handling

### Loading States
- Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- Displays "Loading Dashboard..." message

### Error States
- Shows error icon and message if data fetch fails
- Provides retry button to attempt data fetch again
- Graceful fallback to empty states

### Empty States
- "No low stock items" when all products have sufficient stock
- "No recent transactions" when no sales exist

## Performance Optimizations

### Real-time Subscriptions
- Efficient Firestore listeners for real-time updates
- Automatic cleanup of subscriptions when component unmounts
- Debounced updates to prevent excessive re-renders

### Data Caching
- Context-based state management for efficient data sharing
- Memoized calculations for statistics
- Optimized re-renders using React hooks

## Security Considerations

### Role-based Access
- Admin users see all features
- Cashier users see limited features (no inventory management, settings)
- Navigation items filtered based on user role

### Data Validation
- All Firebase queries include proper error handling
- Fallback values for missing or corrupted data
- Input validation for user interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Data Displayed**
   - Check Firebase connection
   - Verify collections exist in Firestore
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Real-time Updates Not Working**
   - Verify Firestore security rules allow read access
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper subscription cleanup

3. **Loading State Stuck**
   - Check Firebase configuration
   - Verify authentication status
   - Check for JavaScript errors in console

### Debug Information
- All Firebase operations include console logging
- Error messages are displayed to users
- Network requests can be monitored in browser dev tools

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Charts and Graphs**: Add visual data representations
2. **Export Functionality**: Allow data export to CSV/PDF
3. **Custom Date Ranges**: Filter data by custom date ranges
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications for low stock alerts
5. **Offline Support**: Cache data for offline viewing
6. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed business insights

## Support

For issues or questions about the dashboard functionality:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase configuration and permissions
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Test with sample data to isolate issues
